I wrote this script to find marks of students of my school and also to learn selenium and beautifulsoup while i wrote this.

In order suit the script to your needs modify the **`script.py`**. The various difficult looking lines have been annotate to make it easy to understand.

To run the script make sure you have **Python3** with **selenium**, **Chrome webdriver executable** and **beautifulsoup** installed.
